## Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
&rarr; An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the brain. ANNs, like people, learn by examples. An ANN is configured for a specific application, such as pattern recognition or data classification, through a learning process

## Backpropagation
&rarr; Backpropagation is a standard method of training artificial neural networks. It is a process involved in training a neural network. It involves taking the error rate of a forward propagation and feeding this loss backward through the neural network layers to fine-tune the weights. Backpropagation is the essence of neural net training
